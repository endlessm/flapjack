Description: Tool for developing components inside a flatpak runtime
 Flapjack is a tool that lets you hack on one or more of the components
 inside a flatpak runtime. You can make changes to the components and build
 a new "development SDK" with your changed components. You can then test
 your flatpak apps by running them against the development SDK.
