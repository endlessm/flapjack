Version 0.1.5
=============

- Added a new `--verbose` option, which shows the git, flatpak, and
  flatpak-builder commands that flapjack runs internally.
  Giving the option twice (`-vv`) also runs flatpak-builder with its own
  `--verbose` option.
  Thanks to Juan Pablo Ugarte for this feature!
- Fixed a bug that caused installing extensions from a user remote to
  fail. (Cosimo Cecchi)
- Various minor fixes from Cosimo Cecchi, Manuel Qui√±ones, and Philip
  Chimento.

Version 0.1.4
=============

- Added a new command, `flapjack clean-cache`, which deletes the
  flatpak-builder cache.
  Thanks to Emmanuele Bassi for this feature ü•û!
- Now, `flapjack run` and `flapjack shell` don't update the runtimes,
  since this is largely redundant due to updating at the end of a run
  of `flapjack build`.
- Fixed a bug whereby modules' `test-commands` keys were ignored.
- Now, extensions listed in the `add_extensions` config key are
  installed during `flapjack setup`.
  This should fix errors about missing extensions.
- Whitespace is now stripped from config file keys.
- Made some changes to the example config file.

Version 0.1.3
=============

- Added a `add_extensions` config key which should solve some of the
  problems around building with gtk-doc enabled.
- `flapjack open` now works even if you don't have an internet
  connection.

Version 0.1.2
=============

- Add support for changing the shell prompt when inside a Flapjack
  shell. Customize the prefix with `shell_prefix` in your config file.
  If you already have a custom prompt, include `$FLAPJACK_PROMPT_PREFIX`
  in your `$PS1` variable.
  Thanks to Manuel Qui√±ones for this feature ü•û!
- Add support for autocompleting commands. Follow the instructions in
  the README to activate this. Thanks to Manuel Qui√±ones for this
  feature too!
- Fixed a thing in the example config file.

Version 0.1.1
=============

- Uses rofiles once again when building, since building without it made
  things a lot slower. If you have problems with the "Read-only
  filesystem" error, use `ensure-writable` in your manifest.
- Fixed `config-opts` not getting added in the right order.
- Fixed some mistakes in the example config file.

Version 0.1.0
=============

- Added module-specific `extra_build_args`, `extra_make_args`,
  `extra_test_args`, and `extra_make_install_args` config keys with
  shell-style quoting.
- Added module-specific `[module_name.extra_env]` section where the
  config keys are interpreted as extra environment variables.
- Config keys are case-insensitive now.
- Allows shell-style quoting in the `extra_config_opts` config key.
- Made `flapjack open` print a warning when opening a module with a
  non-git source, with a suggestion of what to do.
- Now doesn't use rofiles when building, in order to accommodate
  modules that overwrite instead of replace files on install.
- Made `flapjack build` discard the build directories of successful
  builds.
- Fixed bugs around defaults for keys not specified in the config file.

Version 0.0.2
=============

- Now makes sure that the Locale extensions are completely installed,
  in order to avoid the dreaded "Locale only partially installed" error.

Version 0.0.1
=============

- Added `sdk_branch` config key to allow picking the branch of the
  SDK that you want to base your dev SDK on.
- Added `user_installation` config key to allow operating with
  `flatpak --user`.
- Added module-specific `url`, `extra_cflags`, `extra_cppflags`,
  `extra_cxxflags`, and `extra_ldflags` config keys to allow a bit more
  customization of a module's build.
- Switched the config file format to Python's "configparser" INI-style
  format.
- Made `flapjack update` keep going when failing to fetch one repo.
- Now installs the Debug extension of your dev SDK automatically.
- Fixed using a custom location for the checkout path.
- Fixed `flapjack update` trying to fetch a git repo with no remote.
- Fixed not having a `dev_tools_manifest` key in the config file.
- Fixed `flapjack build` when some SDK extensions aren't installed.

Version 0.0.0
=============

Initial release.
